# INBOT: AI-Driven Internal Inquiry Assistant

## Overview
The AI-Driven Internal Inquiry Assistant is a transformative chatbot library designed to facilitate seamless access to corporate knowledge bases. Leveraging advanced natural language processing, this tool provides timely and context-aware support to employees, enhancing efficiency and engagement within the workplace.

## Company Requirements

To ensure the successful deployment and optimal functioning of the AI-Driven Internal Inquiry Assistant, companies must meet the following requirements:

### Database System
- **Structured Database**: A structured database system, such as SQL or NoSQL, is essential for storing critical data such as HR policies, technical support information, and project management resources.
- **Accessibility**: The database must permit secure querying by the AI model to fetch and process information as needed by the chatbot.

### Communication Platform Integration
- **Corporate Tools**: The library is crafted to integrate seamlessly with established corporate communication platforms including Slack, Microsoft Teams, and other comparable internal messaging systems.
- **Employee Access**: Integration ensures that the chatbot is readily accessible to employees, facilitating a more dynamic and interactive communication environment.

### Data Preparation Methodology
- **Data Handling**: A comprehensive methodology for data preparation, including data cleansing and annotation processes, is incorporated to align with stringent data protection laws.
- **Compliance**: Companies are required to adhere to the Data Preparation Report guidelines, ensuring that sensitive information is managed in accordance with GDPR and other relevant standards.

### Computational Resources
- **Hardware**: Sufficient computational resources, potentially entailing cloud-based AI services or on-premise servers, are required to support the demands of model training and machine learning workloads.

### Collaboration and Compliance
- **IT Collaboration**: Effective deployment hinges on the collaborative efforts between the project team and corporate IT departments to assure smooth integration and data accessibility.
- **Legal and Ethical Standards**: Companies must commit to using the library in compliance with all pertinent legal and ethical policies.

### Support for Limited Database Access
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: In instances where direct access to the corporate database is restricted or involves sensitive data, the library provides tools to generate synthetic data to aid in model training.

### Integration Support
- **Custom Integration Solutions**: Should any challenges arise in integrating the chatbot with specific communication tools, the project team is prepared to create bespoke integration modules to accommodate the unique needs of different corporate environments.
